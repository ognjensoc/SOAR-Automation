# SOAR Automation

## Objective

Designed and automated a SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) workflow using LimaCharlie (EDR) and Tines to detect malicious activity (e.g., "hack tool" execution), trigger alerts, and execute response actions. The project focused on creating playbooks to notify analysts via Slack/email, prompt user decisions, and automate machine isolation based on user input, simulating real-world SOC incident response processes.

### Skills Learned

- SOAR/EDR Integration: Connecting LimaCharlie (EDR) with Tines (SOAR) for automated threat detection and response.
- Playbook Design: Building logic-driven workflows for incident triage (Slack/email alerts, user prompts, isolation actions).
- Automation Scripting: Configuring Tines to execute actions (e.g., machine isolation via LimaCharlie API).
- Collaboration Tools: Sending formatted alerts to Slack/email with contextual data (time, IP, process details).
- Workflow Visualization: Mapping processes using draw.io to plan and refine playbook logic. 

### Tools Used

- LimaCharlie: Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) platform for detecting malicious activity.
- Tines: SOAR platform for automating playbooks and response actions.
- Slack/Email: Communication tools for alerting analysts.
- APIs: Integrating LimaCharlie and Tines for automated isolation commands.
